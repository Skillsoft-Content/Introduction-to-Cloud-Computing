You can always check the description for the session to confirm the date for that replay.To get to the right area in Percipio, please follow these steps: 1. Log into Percipio2. Select 'Library' > 'Skillsoft Bootcamps'3. Choose 'Cloud Services' Bootcamps4. Then choose 'Introduction to Cloud Computing Bootcamp'
