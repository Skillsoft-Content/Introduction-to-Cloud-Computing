You can always check the description for the session to confirm the date for that replay.To get to the right area in Percipio, please follow these steps: 1. Log into Percipio2. Select 'Library' > 'Skillsoft Bootcamps'3. Choose 'Cloud Services' Bootcamps4. Then choose 'Introduction to Cloud Computing Bootcamp'
04:36:41	David Robichaud:	I just wanted to mention that we have a short survey that we would like you to complete after the session. We would love to get your feedback on your bootcamp experience and get input on any areas or topics that you would like to see covered in a future bootcamp.Survey URL:https://surveys.skillsoft.com/jfe/form/SV_1Hb2mSZpvbE0vu6
